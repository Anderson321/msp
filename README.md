# MultiWii Communication Library (C++)

This library implements the MultiWii Serial Protocoll ([MSP](http://www.multiwii.com/wiki/index.php?title=Multiwii_Serial_Protocol)) for communicating with a MultiWii flight controller (FC) over a serial device.
It currently implements the sending and reading from a serial device and defines some of the messages and encoding/decoding functions for raw data.
